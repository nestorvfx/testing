// This patch enhances our voice recognition system to make it more robust

// 1. Make VoiceButton component more robust with better speech result tracking and error handling
// - Improved de-duplication of speech results to avoid duplicate captures
// - Better handling of pauses between sentences 
// - Enhanced error recovery
// - Automatic restart after errors

// 2. Enhance App.js to better handle multiple speech prompts
// - Removed code that turned off voice recognition after a capture
// - Created a queuing system for processing multiple speech results
// - Added retry mechanisms for voice recognition
// - Added better error handling and recovery

// These changes ensure that each complete speech prompt correctly triggers a photo
// capture, instead of only capturing with the second prompt as observed in logs.
