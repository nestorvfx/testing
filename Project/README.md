# PerplexitySceneCapture

A responsive React Native app that records using the device's camera and automatically captures the center square portion of the video feed every 5 seconds. The captured images are displayed as overlapping cards in the bottom left of the screen.

## Features

- Camera access with permission handling
- Automatic square image capture every 5 seconds during recording
- Voice-activated capture with custom prompts
- Speech recognition for hands-free operation
- Responsive design that adapts to device orientation changes
- Visual indicator of the capture area in the center of the screen
- Card-style display of captured images in the bottom left corner
- Recording state indicator
- Simple record/stop button interface

## How to Use

1. Start the app
2. Grant camera, microphone and media permissions when prompted
3. Press the "Record" button to begin recording, or use voice commands

## Development Setup

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm start

# Run on Android
npm run android

# Run on iOS
npm run ios

# Run on Web
npm run web
```

## Production Builds

To create production builds with all debug code and console logs removed:

```bash
# For Android
npm run prod:android

# For iOS
npm run prod:ios

# For Web
npm run build:web
```

The production builds use Babel's transform-remove-console plugin to automatically strip all console.log statements from the code while preserving critical error messages.

## Configuration

The app uses various configuration files:

- `app.json` - Expo configuration
- `babel.config.js` - Babel configuration, including console log removal for production
- `eas.json` - EAS Build configuration
4. The app will automatically capture images every 5 seconds
5. Captured images appear as cards in the bottom left
6. Press "Stop" to end recording and capture process

## Android Microphone Permissions

For Android users experiencing microphone issues:
1. Make sure you've granted microphone permissions to the app
2. Use the microphone test button (üéôÔ∏è) to verify your microphone is working
3. If issues persist, try restarting the app or your device
4. Check that no other apps are currently using the microphone

## Technical Implementation

- Uses Expo Camera for video recording
- Azure Speech Services for voice recognition
- Responsive layout adapts to orientation changes
- Capture area is determined by the smaller dimension of the screen
- Images are stored in an array with a limit of 10 for performance
- Overlapping card effect created with negative margins and z-index
